## Featured Projects

### Lane Detection from Driving Videos
Python · OpenCV · Computer Vision

A computer vision system for detecting lane boundaries and road structure in
driving videos across multiple scenarios, including curved roads, pedestrian
crosswalks, and night-time conditions.

The project emphasizes geometric reasoning, temporal consistency, and robustness
across varying environments.
