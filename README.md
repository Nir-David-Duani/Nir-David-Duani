## Featured Projects

### Lane Detection from Driving Videos
Python · OpenCV · Classical Computer Vision

A modular computer vision system for detecting lane boundaries and road structure
in driving videos across multiple scenarios, including curved roads, pedestrian
crosswalks, and night-time conditions.

The project emphasizes geometric reasoning, temporal consistency, and robustness
using classical image processing techniques.

### Planar Augmented Reality
Python · OpenCV · Camera Geometry · PnP

A classical computer vision pipeline for planar augmented reality. The system
tracks planar targets in video and renders virtual content with correct
perspective, camera pose, and occlusion handling.

The project includes camera calibration, homography-based tracking, pose
estimation using solvePnP, and multi-plane visualization.
