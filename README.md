## Featured Projects

### Planar Augmented Reality
Python · OpenCV · Camera Geometry · PnP

An augmented reality pipeline that tracks planar targets in video and renders
virtual content with correct perspective, camera pose, and occlusion handling.

The project includes camera calibration, homography-based tracking, pose
estimation using solvePnP, and multi-plane visualization.

### Lane Detection from Driving Videos
Python · OpenCV · Computer Vision

A computer vision system for detecting lane boundaries and road structure in
driving videos across multiple scenarios, including curved roads, pedestrian
crosswalks, and lane changes.

The project emphasizes geometric reasoning, temporal consistency, and robustness
across varying environments.
